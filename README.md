Lab 5: Face Detection and Clustering using K-Means Algorithm

AIM:
The primary objective of this lab is to:
1. Implement face detection using Haar Cascade classifiers 
2. Extract colour-based features (Hue and Saturation) from the detected face
3. Perform unsupervised clustering using the K-Means algorithm
4. Classify a template image (Dr Shashi Tharoor) into one of the discovered clusters
5. Visualise clustering results and analyse the effectiveness of colour-based face classification 

METHOD:
Step 1: Face Detection
1. Loaded Plaksha Faculty group image
2. Converted to grayscale
3. Applied Haar Cascade Classifier with parameters
4. Drew red bounding boxes around detected faces
